# FlowAlign: Trajectory-Regularized, Inversion-Free Flow-based Image Editing

This repository is the official implementation of FlowAlign, an inversion & training free image editing algorithm.

## Requirements

Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/FlowAlign/FlowAlign.git
cd FlowAlign
```

To install requirements:

```
conda create -n flowalign python==3.11
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda activate flowalign
```

## Quick Start
For the text-based image editing, run:

```
python run_edit.py
```

The expected result is below.

## How to choose editing methods

You can freely change the editing method using arguments:
- `method` : dual / sdedit / flowedit / flowalign


## Efficient inference

If you use `--efficient_memory`, text encoder will pre-compute text embeddings and is removed from the GPU.

This allows us to solve inverse problem with a single GPU with VRAM 24GB.
