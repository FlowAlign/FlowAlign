# FlowAlign: Trajectory-Regularized, Inversion-Free Flow-based Image Editing

This repository is the official implementation of FlowAlign, an inversion & training free image editing algorithm.

### Abstract

ðŸ’¡ Recent inversion-free, flow-based editors leverage models like Stable Diffusion 3 to enable text-driven image editing via ODE integration.

ðŸ¤” However, skipping latent inversion often leads to unstable trajectories and poor source consistency.

ðŸš€ **FlowAlign** addresses this by introducing a flow-matching lossâ€”a simple yet effective regularizer that ensures smooth, semantically aligned, and structurally consistent edits.

ðŸŒŸ Thanks to its ODE-based formulation, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing, highlighting its reversible and robust transformation capability.

## Requirements

Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/FlowAlign/FlowAlign.git
cd FlowAlign
```

To install requirements:

```
conda create -n flowalign python==3.11
conda activate flowalign
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start
For the text-based image editing, run:

```
python run_edit.py
```

The expected result is below.

## How to choose editing methods

You can freely change the editing method using arguments:
- `method` : dual / sdedit / flowedit / flowalign


## Efficient inference

If you use `--efficient_memory`, text encoder will pre-compute text embeddings and is removed from the GPU.

This allows us to solve inverse problem with a single GPU with VRAM 24GB.
